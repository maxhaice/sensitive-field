`Tiles downloading instruction`
===============

## Introduction

One of key components of the `Sensitive Field` project is a map. The map is used to notify users about new events and to show them a history of previous events. To let the map to work requires a lot of small pieces of images which may be sticked together to see some part of territory of the world. The one piece is a **tile**, and this instruction is about "How to download the tiles of specific region of the world to use them in `Sensitive Field` project".
